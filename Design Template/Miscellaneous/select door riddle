Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind
your fate will be decided, by whichever door you find.

One among us seven will let you move ahead,
another will transport the traveller back instead*.

2 among our number, are virtually harmless
3 are rigged with bombs, won't leave you painless.

Choose, unless you wish to stay here forever more
to help you in your choice, you have these clues four.

1st, however slyly the bomb tries to hide
you'll always find some on harmless one's right side.

2nd, different are those who stand at either end
but if you would move onwards, neither is your friend.

3rd, as you clearly see, all are different size
neither dwarf nor giant hold death in their insides.

4th, the second left and second on the right
are twins, once you realize, though different at first sight.
